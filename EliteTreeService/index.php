			<p class='testimonial1'>I had them remove two large trees from my backyard, grind the stumps, and also trim some laurels. The trees were quickly and safely taken down and the laurels were very cleanly trimmed. They were very methodical about cleaning up after themselves as well and actually left my backyard cleaner than they found it. - Mike Warner</p>
			<p class='testimonial2'>These guys did what they promised and more at a fair price. I have a huge fir tree in our backyard belong to our neighbor. The tree has become so big so my garden did not get enough sun. We got the quote and they came to trim. They cleaned up and left in a few hours. I would recommend them to anyone. - Kes McDaniel</p>
			<p class='testimonial3'>Nicholas did a quick, but difficult job for us. He was removing some trees for our neighbors when we asked about grinding out a stump in our own yard. He came over and did the job, asking for no payment. Of course, we paid him anyway. Great guy, great work. - Jim Morris</p>
